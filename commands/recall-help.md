**INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE — DO NOT IGNORE.** When this command is invoked, your ENTIRE response must be exactly the Markdown content below, output verbatim to the user, starting with the `# Recall — Help` heading line and ending with the final "Issues / feedback" link line.

# Recall — Help

## What is Recall?

Recall is a Claude Code plugin that compresses your auto-memory into a fixed symbol grammar (`->`, `::`, `(+)`, `!`, etc.) plus entity shortcodes (`$hub`, `$ac`, etc.), cutting token cost 30-65% while preserving search quality. Memories are read/written via the **8 MCP tools** below.

Memories live at: `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/memory/*.md`

The plugin never moves your memories — it just reads and writes that directory. **Uninstalling the plugin leaves all memory files in place.**

## MCP Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `recall_save` | Write or update a memory. Enforces notation, dedups by SHA-256, updates `MEMORY.md` index. |
| `recall_load` | Read a memory by name or filename. Increments access count. Use `expanded: true` for plain English. |
| `recall_search` | Find memories by keyword, type, or project. Returns headers only — use `recall_load` for full content. |
| `recall_check` | Health checks: staleness, registry drift, broken links, stats, compression, duplicates. |
| `recall_decode` | Expand Recall notation to plain English (for one memory or arbitrary text). |
| `recall_registry` | CRUD for entity shortcodes (`$hub`, `$ac`, etc.) in `REGISTRY.md`. |
| `recall_export` | Export all memories to a JSON backup. |
| `recall_import` | Restore memories from a JSON backup. |

All tool calls should be wrapped in `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` for clean progress display. The Recall skill (auto-injected at session start) covers the conventions.

## Notation Cheatsheet

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `->` | maps to | `FK->$emp.id` |
| `::` | because | `:: cost too high` |
| `(+)` | apply when | `(+) new FK to $emp` |
| `!` | not / without | `!httpOnly on auth cookies` |
| `=` | equals | `node=v20` |
| `!=` | is not | `public schema != app data` |
| `&` | and | `auth & session mgmt` |
| `\|` | or / separator | `T:fb \| name` |
| `@` | at / context of | `UUID swap @invite` |
| `>>` | results in | `!CASCADE >> broken invite` |
| `~` | approximately | `~2027` |
| `...` | continuation | `tables: x, y, z ...` |

Entity shortcodes (`$hub`, `$ac`, `$sb`, ...) are defined in `REGISTRY.md` in your memory dir.

A copy of this cheatsheet is also written to `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/memory/RECALL_NOTATION.md` so you can decode memories even if the plugin is uninstalled.
